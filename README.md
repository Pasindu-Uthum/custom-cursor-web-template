This is a web template created by me, inspired by the original website https://custom-cursor.com/products/custom-cursor-for-windows.

This is made only for the testing.
And also only for desktop users.

Warning - This is not a responsive web design. So never try to check the responsive effect. If you are a web developer, I highly recommend you not to try this on a mobile or any other small device as well as don't go to the inspect. otherwise, it will be a horrible experience.

But there are Responsive Web Designs too: https://pasindu-uthum.github.io/W3SchoolsWebTemplates/
